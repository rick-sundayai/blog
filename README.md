## Creating an AI Communications Agent for the Blog
Executive Summary of Evaluation:
Focusing on general tech enthusiasts makes the content strategy more coherent. Shifting the goal to generating consulting leads is a far more viable path for a blog with lower posting frequency than pursuing ad revenue. Your personal journey remains a strong differentiator. The primary challenge now is effectively reaching this audience and positioning the content specifically to demonstrate consulting-level expertise and clearly signal your availability for paid work. The blog serves effectively as a portfolio and credibility builder.
